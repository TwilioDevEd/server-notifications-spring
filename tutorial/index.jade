      ## What does this thing do?

      This [Spring](https://spring.io/) sample application demonstrates
      how to send SMS alerts to a list of system administrators if something goes
      wrong on your server. In this tutorial, we'll show you the key bits of code
      to make this work.

      Let's get started!

      ## List server admins

      Create a list of administrators who should be notified if a server error occurs.
      The only requirement we have is a `phoneNumber`.

      ## Configure Twilio client

      In order to send a message we'll need to initialize the [Twilio Java Helper
      Library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/java/install),
      which requires reading our `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
      defined as environment variables.

      ## Handle all errors

      Spring MVC provides several techniques to handle errors, our main goal is
      to handle errors across all the application, so that we are going make use
      of [**Global Exception
      Handling**](https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc#global-exception-handling)

    :markdown
      ## Create a custom alert message

      Here we create an alert message to send out via text message. You might also
      decide to include a picture with your alert message, maybe a screenshot of the
      application when the crash happened?

  data-highlight='25')
    :markdown
      ## Reading the admins from the JSON file

      Next we read the admins from our JSON file. We're relying on
      [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) Java library to convert a
      JSON into Java Objects, to do it we use the method `fromJson` to read all
      the objects.

      ## Sending a text message

      There are the three parameters needed to [send an
      SMS](https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/java/sms/sending-via-rest)
      using the [Twilio REST API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest):
      `From`, `To`, `Body`, and `MediaUrl`. After the message is sent, we print out the
      phone number we're texting. [US phone
      numbers](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/is-mms-supported-for-all-carriers-in-us-and-canada)
      can also send an image with the message.

      ## Where to next?

      That's it! We've just implemented an automated server notification system
      that can send you server alerts if anything goes wrong. If you're a Java
      developer working with Twilio, you might want to check out these other
      tutorials.
